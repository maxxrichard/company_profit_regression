# Estimating the company's profit using the Linear Regression model.
This repository contains the implementation of one of the supervised learning model called linear regression in predicting the total profit of the company based on their different expenditures.

## Problem Statement
The US-based multinational company has three branches in different locations, i.e. New York, California, Florida. The company is spending its share in Research & Developement, Administration and Marketing and making a total profit from these different expenditures. Now, the company would like to know how can they maximise the profit by spending their share in fair amount among different expenditures at different locations.

## Packages
This project is implemented in python. The following python-based packages are used:
